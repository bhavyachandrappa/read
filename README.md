# YouNote
   <p>YouTube is always the go-to place for maximum of the population to have the quick lookups at the topics which are of their interest. The users tend to use YouTube to access the information related to cooking recipes, information of technology etc. While watching or learning through these videos, users might require marking out some time points of their interest or write down some notes. Currently, there is no application which provides these both functionalities and so the users must switch between YouTube and the notepad applications for writing and saving notes. Hence, we have developed the YouNote Application which will tackle this problem.</p>
    <p>YouNote has been developed with the objective of assisting the user in their learning process using the YouTube videos. This application allows the user to take the notes while watching the YouTube videos which run through this application itself. Besides educational purpose, this application also has the potential to be used for other purposes. For example, a user who is interested to watch any entertainment kind of video can also mark out the time points can later playback the video between these points. So, YouNote targets a broad range of users from different field and age groups who use YouTube for information, learning or entertainment. In addition, YouNote not only just allows the user to take notes but also allows them to manage and edit the notes. The user is also provided with the flexibility to pause, rewind or replay the video for taking the notes and allows them to go over to something that they didn’t understand.</p>
     <p>YouNote doesn’t have any constraints related to the environments in which it can be used. User can use this application almost everywhere that is in library or classrooms for learning and in public transits for entertainment. YouNote can be executed and supports all android devices such as phones, tablets and Chromebooks. So, the user has the flexibility to use this application on any preferred devices based on their purpose.</p>

## Code Examples
**Problem 1: How could an activity take data from a fragment inside of it**
<p>We needed to implement a “play back” function to allow user to play the video back to the eslaped time when the note was taken. To do this, we needed the note fragment to send data (eslaped time in this case) to notebook activity which uses the data (elapsed time) to play the video back to a specific time. </p>

<p>public void onFragmentInteraction(Uri uri) { </br>
   String uriStr = uri.toString();</br>
   String[] uriStrList = uriStr.split(" ");</br>
   if(uri != null && uriStrList[0].equals("pause")){</br>
       // Pause the video if TakeNote button is pressed in NoteModeFragment.
       // Referred from: http://blog.csdn.net/fengge34/article/details/46391453</br>
       initializeYoutubePlayer(); //b</br>
       player.pause();</br>
       // Take the elapsedTime</br>
       elapsedTime = player.getCurrentTimeMillis();</br>
   }</br>
   else if(uri != null && uriStrList[0].equals("replay")){</br>
       // Convert the passed time (in uriStrList[1]) from string to int</br>
       String noteTime = uriStrList[1];</br>
       int msNoteTime = Integer.valueOf(noteTime);</br>
       //play the video back to the note time</br>
       player.seekToMillis(msNoteTime);</br>
   }</br>
}</p>

**Problem 2: We needed to override the method when user press the back button on the phone to navigate user to different UIs based on user’s status**
<p>We override onBackPressed() function for the notebook activity to give an alert of closing current notebook to user and also navigate user to different UIs after the user closes the notebook. For instance, a registered user is navigated to an after-login UI, while a guest user is navigated to the main page once the notebook is closed. </p>

<p>@Override</br>
public void onBackPressed() {</br>
   Dialog deleteConfirmBox = new android.support.v7.app.AlertDialog.Builder(GuestActivity.this) </br>
           .setMessage("Leave current notebook?")</br>
           .setPositiveButton("Yes", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {</br>
               public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int whichButton) {</br>
                   if(isRegisteredUser() && previousActivity != null) {</br>
                       Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), UserNoteBooks.class);</br>
                       intent.putExtra("USER_TYPE", "REGISTERED");</br>
                       startActivity(intent);</br>
                   } else if(isRegisteredUser() && previousActivity == null){</br>
                       Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), AfterLoginActivity.class);</br>
                       intent.putExtra("USER_TYPE", "REGISTERED");</br>
                       startActivity(intent);</br>
                   } else if (!isRegisteredUser()){</br>
                       Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MainActivity.class);</br>
                       startActivity(intent);</br>
                   }</br>
                   dialog.dismiss();</br>
               }</br>
           })</br>
           .setNegativeButton("No", null)</br>
           .create();</br>
   deleteConfirmBox.show();</br>
}</p>
